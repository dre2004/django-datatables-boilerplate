# Django datatables boilerplate

This project is an example of using Django and the django-datatables-view plugin, it can be used as a boiler plate or just to get a better understanding of how to use this great plugin.

In this sample project I will demonstrate how to get up and running django-datatables-view as well as moving past that with some additional technologies which are popular at the moement and how to combine them all to make a working Django site. 

In this example I have used two separate databases, the first for the Django admin and authentication and the other is a read only database which could be a real life scenario when you first want to start working with Django.

The sample database used is the the French Towns and Communes from [pgfoundry.org](http://pgfoundry.org/projects/dbsamples/). 

I have only tested this project with Python 3.x (specifically 3.7.0b3), running on Linux Mint 19 Tara and Postgres SQL 10.5. In theory you should be able to use whatever database you have access to (SQLlite should also work).
